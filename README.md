Hello My weather app was created to showcase using React hooks.
This Weather App allows the user to enter in a city and by using longitude and latitude, along with fetching the current weather for the city, not only displays the weather for the day, but also the entire week.
The Weather App also gives an option to show Celsius or Fahrenheit if the user chooses.
